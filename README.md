**Asa Suite: Waypoints** is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon that enhances the default map pin system by adding a `/way` command and a waypoint queue.

## Features

- **Waypoint Queue**: Automatically sets the next waypoint in your queue when you reach your current destination.
- **Easy Commands**: Create waypoints using simple chat commands, similar to other popular waypoint addons.
- **Default Integration**: Uses the standard Blizzard Map Pin system and Super Track for a seamless experience.

## Usage

### Commands

- `/way x y` - Sets a waypoint at coordinates (x, y) in your current zone.
- `/way #mapID x y` - Sets a waypoint at coordinates (x, y) in the specified map ID.
- `/way clear` - Clears the current active waypoint and automatically sets the next one in the queue.
- `/way clear all` - Clears the current waypoint and wipes the entire queue.
- `/way help` - Displays the help message in-game.

### Examples

- `/way 45.5 60.2` (Current zone)
- `/way #2024 50 50` (Specific map ID)
